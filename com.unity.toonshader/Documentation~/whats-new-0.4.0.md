## HDRP Box Light.

In animation and game production, there are times when you want to use lighting that differs from the scene in order to show the face of a character more clearly or to add shadows that look ideal. However, in HDRP, there is a limit to the number of directional lights that can be used to create shadows. The Box Light feature is a workaround for this, and UTS now supports it. UTS also supports this box light, but it is currently limited by the fact that raytraced shadows cannot be used with this box light.
